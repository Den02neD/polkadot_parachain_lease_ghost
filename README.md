# Polkadot Ghost Slot Oracle ◉̷̴̷̴̷̴̷̴◉

In Polkadot,  
parachains are not networks.  
They are **leased realities**.

Most run forever.  
Some get evicted.

This script does not watch tokens.  
It waits for the exact moment  
a crowd-loaned universe  
with millions of dollars and thousands of believers  
receives its final notice:

“Your slot expires in 28 days.  
Pack your state and leave.”

No drama.  
No explosion.  
Just quiet, merciless expiration  
of an entire parallel ecosystem.

```bash
python polkadot_parachain_lease_ghost.py
